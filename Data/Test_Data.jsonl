Do you really think that, in making Sweden more liberal, the situation would improve? Do you really think that Syrians/Turks etc. are intrinsically bad people? I know friends who visited Syria before the war and they were impressed by the people. The problem is that you took a lot of immigration (too much) without integrating them and it is the same problem all over Europe. Without a proper integration system, the people remain ignorant and then they grow attached to things like religion. Not only that: with high unemployment, the people are then more prone to enter criminal organizations. Guys, it is common sense, nothing more. I was a kid when my family migrated from Yugoslavia to Italy, my father learned Italian and found a job quickly because of a guy who was a humanitarian that helped him and many others. Right now I'm almost in my 40s and I have a university degree, a good job (my brother the same) and my family's criminal record is none whatsoever, and that's because my family was quickly integrated. And we know many Yugoslav Muslim families with the same situation, not criminals but taxpayers, even owners of companies. Right now I cannot see a quick solution to the Sweden situation but since it is nearly impossible to deport all the migrants, mostly because the countries of origin will not accept them, you have to find a smart way to integrate them.

I guess I will just delete it then, since I feel it was quite controversial anyway with all the immigrant/refugee integration things. In short, we have the same problems all of Europe has with immigration/integration and that has led to stricter laws. And Muslims are over-represented as being problemetic immigrants/refugees. I can't say for sure why, except we experience some of them clearly don't want to adapt to our country and way of life.   I've been to Amsterdam a couple of times, and I liked it a lot. I guess we all just like what we don't have ourselves. Copenhagen, as it's a big city, also has higher crime rates than smaller places, but it's not too bad compared to places abroad I guess. Ørestad BTW wasn't well-liked at all when it was built, but I think that has probably changed.  I did not know of the Empire Building plane crash. I guess a B-25 would be smaller than a commercial jet though and with less fuel? I don't know.  I think all wars have in common that it's the will and power trips of men, regardless of which ideology they allege to fight for. I'm fully aware which countries Russia have been invading yes. I believe their long-term plan is to restore their landmass to the time of Imperial/Tsarist Russia, when you look at what their politicians have said. Meaning they also want to grab the Baltic countries and Finland, if that's the case. Probably also other NATO countries. I don't recall off the top of my head the exact borders of Imperial Russia.  Soviet Russia won both the Winter and Continuation Wars, but it's considered a Finnish victory because they withstood and still exist as a sovereign country, and it cost the Soviets a lot in man power. Finland today, has 64 F-18s that are going to be replaced with 64 F-35As, so they're not without muscle. And they're looking to buy Israeli anti-air systems now. Russia has a very poor navy, even during Soviet times. Only their nuclear submarines are good. Several countries in NATO have better navies than Russia individually. But yes, Finland's navy would not be a match, it's small. Russia should have a great airforce on paper, but after 5 months they don't have air superiority in Ukraine, so their actual capability may be questionable. With Sweden and Finland in NATO, Russia's Baltic Fleet is completely surrounded. It's a massive strategic loss for Russia, directly on the account of invading Ukraine.  NATO, to my knowledge, went offensive in Bosnia 1995 and Serbia 1999 + Afghanistan 2001 + Libya 2011. Bosnia and Libya were with a UN Resolution to prevent ethnic cleansing/genocide in Bosnia and Libya was to prevent Gaddafi from bombing his own population. Serbia is the only technically illegal war, but was to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Afghanistan is the only time article 5 was used, due to 9/11. Taliban housed terrorists and didn't want to hand them over, so that's a fair war in my view, but they probably shouldn't have tried nation building. Only Afghanistan was a land invasion as far as I know.  In terms of US, I don't agree with the Iraq war or most of their foreign policy. Always meddling and making coups in other countries. But US/Western hypocrisy doesn't excuse Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   If Ukraine war has shown anything, it's that the former Warsaw Pact countries were right to want to join NATO. Their fears of Russia were legitimate. If Russia wants to blame anyone, they can blame themselves. If they behaved like a good neighbour, maybe Eastern Europe would have preferred neutrality and ties with both West and Russia. Ukraine war happened because Russia wants to either annex it or have a pro-Russian puppet regime there.  With continued Western support Russia will lose. I think Ukraine may lose some land, but they will \"win\" in the sense that they will continue to exist. Russia doesn't have the strength to occupy the whole country. An insurgency might force them to leave eventually. In my opinion Russia is bleeding out right now from man power, equipment and ammo. The longer the war continues the worse it gets for Russia. I agree the main enemy is the Putin-regime, but I cannot forget that a majority of Russians support the war (except the youth), even if it's because they're being fed lies from Russian state TV. I try not to blame them, but they will have to be de-Putinfied some day, and learn the truth of his crimes.", "CommentText": "@@navn  (This will be my last message, bringing an end to our discussion, but feel free to give your last reply as well).   It makes sense that immigrants from the Middle East are probably causing more 'problems' in comparison with Western immigrants or non Middle East immigrants. The main reason for this can be found in the differences between culture, religion and values, but also cultural awareness, an open minded character and acceptance of each other have a key rol. For example, if a Syrian immigrant is closed to values and rules of Denmark, it says something about this particular Syrian refugee, however the racism, discrimination, hate or violence of some Danes are also affecting the status of the hard/good working/integrated Syrian refugees. So sometimes, it's not an immigrant problem, but more a problem that is made by the local population (sometimes based on emotional background, such as misinformation and xenophobia) or based on facts, such as real events that happened (like violence or attacks from refugees). But also in my opinion, the local people should first blame their own government, in the end they are the ones letting them in. Just don't let them in and there will be no problem. On the other hand, Europe is promoting democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, however it looks like this doesn't always apply to Middle Eastern refugees and this is actually the source of xenophobia, not seeing them as other human beings. I agree with all parts that every immigrant must integrate in the European society, but I don't think they have to assimilate, they don't have to lose their own identity in order to participate. If that is the case, then the most basic human rights like freedom of religion are taken away. I am not an immigrant, but I have a second background. I see myself as a Dutch, but also as a Turkish person. I am proud of both my nationalities. Coming back to the point, I think if they want to solve the refugee crisis, this should come from both sides. Danes should be less generalizing (not every Syrian refugee is a problem, there are hardworking, highly educated Syrians as well) and in the same way Middle Eastern immigrants must respect the Danish law and integrate in Danish society or they can go back to their own country. I am a strong promoter of integration, but I am against cultural assimilation (it doesn't work).   The hard reality is, during the time of Gadaffi, the country was more advanced, after the invasion it became worser, same with Saddam and Mohamed Morsi. I don't want to go in details, but these people were dangerous for the existence of Israel and the agenda of elites. Many of these coups and invasions are organized by geopolitical reasons, not neccesarily because these countries were killing it's own people or even attacking Europe or NATO or America. Yes they were dictators, but we have seen that the American invasion (or intervention / special military operation) resulted in war crimes as well, leaked by ex CIA Julian Assange which exposes many of the American war crimes in the Middle East. Sadly the genocide against Muslims in Bosnia (Srebrenica) was never prevented, the Dutch army back than was responsible for this prevention, it's still a black page in Dutch history and reminded every year. NATO has it's own geopolitical agenda as well, never underestimate the intentions of military organizations, once they get the power they can turn in monsters themselves. NATO is responsible for many war crimes, like every other country or group that is going to war. Like I said, I don't neccesarily see good guys in war, both parties have their own agenda. About the Russian army, it is true that their military suffered from many modernization programs (lack of resources), however in the end Russia is a nuclear power and that is a game changer and the best argument of not playing dangerous games with Russia. Any country can defend themselves, the question is for how long? Also Russia doesn't want to exterminate Ukraine, they want to replace the current government with a pro Russian regime, so it's likely that Ukraine will lose land (geopolitical shift to isolate direct NATO invasion through Ukraine). You can watch Caspian Report or Real Life Lore (which has a video about the Russian invasion, explained from both sides) if you want to know more about military analysis. The question is not who triggered this war, but rather why it was triggered? This is one of the best videos you can find on the entire internet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If61baWF4GE&ab_channel=RealLifeLore  I can't go in details on every statement/argument of yours, but I have read them all and I understand your point of view. I just want to advice you (like in my earlier comment) war does not neccesarily have a good and a bad guy, sometimes they are both the bad guys and I am specific talking about the regimes only, not the country, not the population, but two regimes that fight each other because of disagreement. Both Ukraine regime and Russian regime have made mistakes and they were not able to solve this in a peaceful way. Two outplayed and angry regimes that had to fight each other, just my opinion, but if you watch the link I send you, it will be better to understand what I mean.   My last point of the discussion I really appreciate your open minded view, I have learned alot of new things from your replies. Most agnostic or atheist people I have had a discussion with were so obsessed with attacking Islam and are very closed to different opinions, you are exactly the opposite. I wish you a nice day and hopefully I may have changed one of your opinions or perspectives on a certain topic, so that you reconsider your thoughts about for example immigrants, Islam, Muslims or anything else we talked about.

I'm also going to give my impression of what's happening in Chile right now. There are bad and good people in every group, and this is a truth that must always be considered! Immigrants have a tendency to seek out and have contact with others of the same nationality, maintaining a cultural bond, but... the immigrant must incorporate himself into the country that welcomed him, understand and accept the local culture, and not want to impose his or her culture (otherwise it is better to return to your country or look for a country with a similar culture). Immigrants should not have the right to vote or be political candidates... I don't consider it right, as there is no guarantee that an immigrant will not try to apply laws that favor their beliefs or their country of origin. Immigrants who do not respect local laws must be deported...! Why do I say all this? Precisely because there are good immigrants who want to work, to be useful to the country that welcomes them, and there are bad immigrants who are criminals or just going to enjoy the advantages that the country offers. I'm not saying that you can't help people, including immigrants, but you have to analyze whether you're really an honest person going through a bad time, or whether you're just someone who tries to take advantage of good citizens. Chile is currently going through a similar situation, with a large population of immigrants (many irregular) who consume State resources and do not contribute to anything... In the north of Chile, prisons contain more than 50% of immigrants, and in Chile, prisoners are not forced to work... The vast majority of land invaders, who demand their own homes, are immigrants... The Chilean State offers everything, but many immigrants believe it is their right to demand and gain all possible benefits, including houses. The big problem is that a society needs people who contribute, and who add behaviors and resources for the well-being of everyone. If a group just gains without giving anything (or very little), the weight falls on those who make an effort. Another point that has not been discussed is ideological, there is migration of people who want to destroy economic systems, cultures, and nations!

You walk through the city center, but you don't see any Germans. There are lots of burkas and headscarves, Arabs, Albanians, Syrians, Iraqi.

And all of this is related to the refugee crisis since 2014/15... The media is trying everything to hide these facts. If crime offenders have a migration background but a German passport, the Media emphasizes that \"the offender was a german\" and anonymize him with typically German names like Wolfgang or Thomas.

I speak Swedish fluently and my wife needed 6 years to learn Swedish almost fluently and on it get herself a master degree in mathematics.  We’re both civil engineers, work and gladly pay taxes. So yes there are immigrants that do well. I see us as an example of it.  However there are two major things we’ve noticed along the way. One, that it has reached a point where too often all immigrants are treated equally, just for being inmigrants. And you have to really work even harder than Swedes to earn some kind of respectable treatment. Two, that relatively many immigrants are unfortunately abusing the system. Me and my wife noticed it first hand. Some, and they are not few, become very comfortable getting payed not doing much for Sweden. It hurts saying it and frustrated me a lot, but it is important to recognize the problems if you want to solve them.  Sweden needs to heavily restrict its immigration policy and demand more from people coming here. But should also encourage people who really work hard and/or are highly educated to be succesful.

A Buddhist might be a peace advocate yet in Myanmar the same religion can became blood thirsty. Very peacefull Christian communities could burn thousands by accusing them performing witchcraft. I think, Religions like catholicism (or traditional muslim communities) or Roman religion etc could be more ok, since foundationalism can be eliminated in them, since the religion itself is more controlled in nature. Yet more selefist versions of Islam, or puritenism etc are more dangerous, since people believe in a book and became radicals. In Turkey the religion was controlled by the state since the earlier Ottoman times, in Turkish areas stoning women etc were uncommon in Ottoman times, or fanaticism was rare( of course there was bigotry etc but islamist terrorism had not originated in Turkey, or Egypt or Morocco). I have not heard any catholic or anglican religious fanatism(there could be zealots, yes, but terrorism? No). It is more about being a controlled religion, not about the Religion's dogmas etc. And about nature of people, well, for example, as I know it is forbidden to smack children in Scandinavia. Were vikings using modern child raising methods? Are not Vikings the ancestors of Scandinavians? How could the modern sweedish society developed from Vikings? Look Germany, France, Uk, and especially to Spain. In 80's the colonial empire of Portugal dissolved. Spain became a democracy after Franco died. Look Poland, today they  do well with Germany but just 80 years ago(within a lifespan of a modern men) were not poking the eye of the German, and Look at Germans, are they the same with 40's Germans. What is the Nature of a German? If one say, the refugees are not obeying the rules, yes during ww2 Germans most probably were more rule obeying than todays refugees, but Look at the Germans of middle ages, or early modern age then. What is the nature? Nature changes, religion adapts. From crusading catholics that burned protestans had the modern catholicism born. From disease and powerty ridden savages of north had the modern Scandinavia born. The Islams problem is different I think. In Islam one must eat the meats of an animal butchered by a believing butcher, that sloughtered with the exact method. Many animals and their products are forbidden, and in more traditional versions many things are further forbidden. An observing muslim can't go with their European friends to drink some beer and socialise. Can't eat everything and mostly they would even avoid going to eat something together. It seems simple, but it creates a major barrier between muslims and others. The religion itself tries to seperate muslims from the rest and it is indeed creating problems in integration. I can't deny it. A Person with traditional Chinese religion or shinto would most probably have less issues at Integration. It is a problem, but when their numbers are in a dealable range, and when locals also try, it is not that hard to integrate them into the society. Neither the Islam is the same with the Islam of 18th century, nor the Christianity, nor the Europeans. And it is not that different, a Sicilian or a Spaniard from a southern Turk or a Syrian etc.", "CommentText": "@@erenkur3832  christians can integrate but not your religion or that other mentionable religion of fake peace they believe they are not supposed to work but steal and own slaves nothing can be innovated or improve with that", "AuthorName": "@janendegwa5462", "Stance_Label": 0}

The video is saying (and I knew this beforehand, because this is a famous fact among us Iranians) that Iranians, are more successful in USA than in Europe. Okay, Iranians can be the best or the worst muslim/non muslims, but that's not my point or the crucial point related to the video here. The same Iranians do better in USA than Europe. And my understanding is that it's because US and Europe themselves.  Also I said that Iranian culture is more compatible with the US culture. I didn't say with \"the western culture\". I also said that the Iranian culture is very different to and not compatible with the Europian Culture. So , my whole point is this. That Europe: Germany, France, Swiss, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and etc, have thick and specific cultures, which are not at all compatible with Iranians and other middle easteners. US is not like that. The 'melting pot' thing. I think US culture allows you more and enables you more, unintentionally, because the have a better culture match, and it becomes unintentionally more welcoming. E.g. the German government has been more welcoming than the US government, but the German people, vice versa.  US people, meaning the US society  is in a way, that a foreigner can more easily and quickly find himself in it. So overall, I cannot put the problem just on foreigners' shoulders. The host culture, society and government play a strong role as well. The cultural 'match'. Iranians and Europe are not a cultural 'match'. I'm saying that as an Iranian.

I didn't intend on even touching that topic with my comments. But since we're here I don't mind Muslims coming in, but devout Muslims are a different matter. Devout Muslims will always stick to their religion. Their religion is very anti Semitic, anti-women, anti-gay and very bigoted.  A large portion of migrants into western countries are Muslim, but will happily adopt western culture to an acceptable degree.  I'll quite happily allow them into our country as long as they can pass through legally. But Devout Muslims are a definite no.  That's my personal opinion on it. Of course there's no solid way to identify whether someone is a devout Muslim or someone who's willing to change. So this is just my personal opinion and not really something I'm saying we can or should implement. It's something with too many problems to be practical.     My original point is that these lessons aren't very effective.  The rude lady on this video said that many Muslim men would pretend to conform just for these lessons, but as soon as they're done with the lessons, they'll inevitably go back to their own ways. That is an exceptionally valid point. And then there's also the fact that the repercussions for not taking these lessons are very small.  Many people who enter our borders still don't truly understand the level of equality we have in our countries. They enter our countries as they have and begin to drag society down.  This is something I really don't appreciate about border policies and it's why I think we need stricter ones. But more specific to these lessons, they need harsher reprmimands to those who do not attend the lessons.  I live in the UK, England. We actually have parts of the country with Muslim communities. People call them \"No-go zones\", but you can enter them so it's not a very fitting name.  These no-go zones have 0 British culture in them. If you enter that zone with anything that the Islamic faith is against, you're guaranteed to get death threats and only about 60% of people there actually understand English.  This is the consequence of not properly teaching people how we behave in our countries. They don't respect us and our way of doing things and it means that the country changes.   This is why I think these lessons are a great idea, but they need to be implemented more firmly rather than having them look like a load of college students that don't really care about their lesson.", "AuthorName": "@bakersmileyface", "Stance_Label": 0}

Some jobs, people are actually replaced by machines not immigrants (just look at an Amazon fulfilment center). I'm not for opening the borders and letting everybody in, but there are studies that link population growth with an increase of GDP (pre-COVID) and the American birth rate is currently declining.

The education level of the US population has fallen behind in the world.  High paying jobs like tech, finance, medical, etc REQUIRE education and skill. In a capitalist society, when supply of qualified labor falls, demand is met by substituting the source of the supply.  The term qualified in this case incorporates education level, experience, work history, etc.  One thing Americans don’t seem to understand is that employers look at everything about candidates for a job. If you quit your last job, have a gap in your resume, etc, all this affects your chance of hire. Immigrants have a unique perspective in that just quitting and walking out on a job is not an option for them. That’s something most Americans are okay with doing.  I mean, how many time have you heard Americans say that they want to explore life, figure out what they want to do in life or even get upset at work and just quit.

For an American company to hire a skilled immigrant, for example under the H or L immigrant visa class, there’s an application process to be completed with the US govt. There’s legal fees, application fees and other associated costs like relocation. To top it off, there’s a min. yearly salary requirement based on the job level and the region. This starts in the range of $70k & up. Which brings us to the question: Why would any employer in the US do this to pay “low wages”. It’s mathematically impossible! Secondly, let’s talk about immigrant contributions to America, starting with this platform we’re on, YouTube. Founded by 3 people, 2 immigrants, 1 American. YouTube was acquired by Google, which was cofounded by an immigrant. Elon Musk is known for 4 companies that have been wildly successful. Elon is a South African immigrant.

{"CommentID": "Ugw8y13DNlgljvYwjGV4AaABAg", "ParentCommentText": "Can The U.S. Economy Survive Without Immigration?", "CommentText": "Comming from a potential international student... I don't think people would like to change the US for China. If we can all agree on something, is that China is way more nationalistic (for obvious reasons) and xenophobic than anyone in the US. The thing that made the United States so good for inmigrants is not just oportunity, but culture; the United States makes you feel part of it, just look at top universities with former Soviet scientists turning into teachers, they can tell you about that. And well for the main factor... if China had the inmigration rate the US has (which is the highest in the world), China would do the same or worse to protect the chinese. Think about this, the US has a ~167 million people in the labor force, China has over 800 million! If the skilled workers from other nations went to China to take their jobs, wouldn't the chinese be upset? They were taught to be nationalistic af, if it isn't chinese it is inferior to them (when it comes to stealing intellectual property is another story until they change the tech a little on their soil). And even tho, in the US there are ~15 million chinese (both workers and students combined).\n\nChina doesn't want foreign-born workers, they want to RETAIN their talent. They have a population similar to all of the Americas and Europe combined, so they would have the capabilitie of living from a domestic labor force. But the problem with that is other nations, being more efficent when it comes to entrepeneurship and overall freedom. The United States, Switzerland, Singapore, the UK, Sweden, Australia, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Irland and Canada, are the nations with the most foreign talent in the overall ranking and some of them are way more competitive, business friendly, open and less corrupt than the chinese market. They have a demand for skilled labor so it works for the chinese that want a drastic change in their way of life.\n\nOld chinese people might not be able to see through China's \"Iron Curtain\", but young people (Gen Z or late Millenials) know how to use a VPN that plays to the \"cat and mouse\" with the CCP censorship. They know about us and our policies, news as they are and how we interpret them in the West. That, plus how hard the chinese university entrance exam is (the Gaokao), makes the US's SAT/ACT an excellent oportunity for a skilled teenager/young adult to obtain a full ride scholarship at a Need-Blind or non-need-blind for internationals rich university. Or with the growing middle class in China, it makes it a great oportunity to aim for a public research university like Purdue, or Berkeley, or in more obvious terms the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaing, which holds over 5,000 chinese students out of its 30,000+ students. \n\nSo... having that in mind, me being an prospective international student from Colombia, if I had to change a United States higher education and potential entrepreneurship oportunities... I would have to study my undergrad here to apply for the Fullbright for a Master's Degree, because even tho the US has expensive education, it has the best scholarships; If I was granted a scholarship at Cambridge, or Oxford, I would still have to pay like US$31k there, and the average colombian makes US$14.7k a year. \n\nSo let's say I go for work, let's say I made my Bachelor in Science, Master in Science and my Ph.D in Colombia (which I don't want to). Changing the US for another nation... I would go to... I dunno. I like a country that can offer me a bit of everything; strong economy, strong education, strong military, strong international relations, that kind of stuff... \n\nWhich would you pick? I'm thinking about... maybe Canada? France? Germany? I dunno... I like the United States a lot, and I'm worried for it. This elections have me nervious... I dunno what would be the best for the US right now.", "AuthorName": "@duh9355", "Stance_Label": 1}

Just because you have to attack the liberal ideas everyday you probably sometimes lost the sense of objectivity..When you make a racial joke, it indicates that the content of the joke and the subject of the joke is inferior or embarassing, otherwise, why make the joke in first place?. There is no going around that.", "CommentText": "I disagree! I love Asian people and Asian culture. But that joke's funny am I as your friends think it is too! It's a stereotype, but everybody I know living in California says it's fairly accurate. Doesn't mean I think Asians are inferior.\nPeople are too damn sensitive and it's ruined comedy! People are different. The differences can be beautiful, but they can also be funny.\nThat NASCAR driver posted a meme teasing a fellow driver, and that clip from family Guy just happened to fit,  not because the other NASCAR driver was half Japanese and if the cartoon lady had been different race he still would have used the clip.\n I feel strongly he wouldn't have done it if the other man wasn't his friend.\nI miss comedy. And apparently there is no issue that doesn't offend everyone on the left. I don't want to live what's left of my life walking on eggshells because people have been trained to react with hysteria over the smallest things!  I bet if that NASCAR driver who posted that meme were not white, we wouldn't have even heard about it. And that's something else that really angers me. Complete double standards! Everyday, I hear people fear mongering about white men, especially straight white men or the worst of the worst \"straight white Evangelical men\" 🙄🙄 for some reason only white evangelicals are wrong. Even though I'm pretty sure the vast majority of predominantly black churches are Evangelical churches, including COGIC.\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is just one more example of punishing a white man for an innocuous incident that a normal person may or may not like, but they wouldn't be outrage! Normal! That's what I'm talking about. Don't we have enough problems in the world without worrying about that meme?", "AuthorName": "", "Stance_Label": 0}

There was a legitimate anti- illegal immigration protest and a legitimate anti-racism counter protest. Unfortunately both sides were hijacked by bad actors. I.e. genocidal slogans and Palestinian flags from the left and rent-a-mob troublemakers on the right. 3 hours in, 2-3 medium sized groups of Asians turned up and joined the anti racism protest and taunting the other side. In short, good faith protest and debate was lost in that moment and devolved into clashes against police with people's businesses damaged and looted.\n\nOur new prime minister is not helping at all with the rhetoric, calling it \"far right thuggery\" and Plymouth's Council Leader just called it \"right wing protest\"", "CommentText": "I did see a couple of post were police cars that were smashed were actually delivered to the location were it \"appeared\" the smashing was orchestrated. Sadly we saw these same tactics in the \"Summer of Love\" like pallets of bricks delivered to random corners in the inner city and a smaller groups within the larger mob of rioters communicating and directing the violence and fanning the flames and smashing windows. These were groups being funded and moved around as \"Professional Protesters\", and also federal agents. This is the Problem intentionally being caused for the planned reaction, so the Solution will be imposed by the bootheel of a government thats been infiltrated and turned like a rabid dog against the people that \"Elected\" it.
